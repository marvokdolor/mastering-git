/* Second Message 5/9/2017:
I just remembered that I actually wrote a blogpost about all the tools I've been using to learn to code: https://mkd16.tumblr.com/post/147940210677/why-an-environmentalist-should-learn-how-to-code
I updated it this evening so it should have all the relevant info.
Cheers,
