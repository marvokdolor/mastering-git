Hey Cris!

This is so cool B-)
I use Atom as my primary text editor. It’s almost identical to Sublime from what I can tell, but they don’t keep asking me to upgrade :-)
 
When I’m doing exercises from all those classes I listed in the blogpost, I use the Python IDLE which I believe comes with Mac or Spyder from Anaconda.

I just came across this git guide: http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/
We’ll see how helpful it is.

Over and out.
